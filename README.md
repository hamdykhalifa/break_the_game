#Break the Game

is a PingPong related Game where the main focus is to break the stones on the wall. 
If the ball doesn't hit the paddle, the bricks as well as your score are reset.

#Canvas

I used the Javascript Canvas API to build the game. The ball, the paddle and the bricks are built in the canvas and move only in there.
It is very easy to change the speed of the ball or the paddle in order to make the game harder.

#Future changes

1.) Design Canvas background image
2.) Let ball be faster with time
3.) Let paddle get smaller => maybe different levels with different paddle sizes?
